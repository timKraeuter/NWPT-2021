Prerequisites:
- Installed java (check with ```java -version```). Tested with version 1.8.0_301.

Run the example using by executing the following command in the bin directory:
```
java -jar Simulator.jar
```
Then load the example by clicking ```File < Open``` and selecting the following:
- **Hierarchical_SM_BPMN.gps** (Hierarchical composition example of the abstract).

## State space generation
Using the graph grammar, one can generate the state space using Groove (Consult the Groove demos in the further resources section if needed).
The following screenshot illustrates the state space (11 States, 12 transitions) generated by Groove.

## Check termination using LTL
The atomic propositions are created in Groove using graph conditions. The termination constraint is formulated as a **LTL property**.
Right-click on the generated state space and choose ```Verify < Check LTL property (full state space)``` and then copy-paste the property listed below.

```
F(G(terminated))
```
